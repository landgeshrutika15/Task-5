Task 5: SQL Joins(Inner,Left,Right,Full)

The goal was to learn how to combine data from multiple tables using different types of SQL joins.

1. Created two related tables using foreign key.

2. write SQL queries using all join types

> Using four types of joins to understand how data can be merged in different ways:

i) INNER JOIN: Returns only the records that have matching values in both tables.

ii) LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.

iii) RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.

iv) FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either table.
